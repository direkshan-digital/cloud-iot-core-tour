## Pre-requisites

- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio 2.2+
- [Rainbow Hat for Android Things](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rainbow-hat-for-android-things) or the following individual components:
    - 1 [bmp280 temperature sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2651)
    - 1 [segment display with I2C backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1270)
    - 1 push button
    - 1 resistor
    - jumper wires
    - 1 breadboard
    - (optional) 1 [APA102 compatible RGB Led strip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2241)
    - (optional) [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) project

## Schematics

If you have the Raspberry Pi [Rainbow Hat for Android Things](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rainbow-hat-for-android-things), just plug it onto your Raspberry Pi 3.

## Build and install

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.
If you prefer to run on the command line, type
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.weatherstation/.WeatherStationActivity
```

If you have everything set up correctly:
- The segment display will show the current "temperature" which will increase with the fan off and decrease with the fan on.
- If a APA102 RGB Led strip is connected, it will display a rainbow of 7 pixels indicating the "fan" state.
